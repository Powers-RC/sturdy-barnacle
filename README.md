# Personal Web Page
This web page was designed to showcase upcoming workes and push myself to develop
a more public portfolio.

## Project State
This is the first iteration of the web page, since I only have an hour here or there 
to work on it, priorizing my projects are important. My next steps are to make the 
web page more monochromatic in style. Right now the site is not up to my standard of
design but is functional, informative, dynamic, and mobile friendly.

This page will constantly be developed and improved over time. 

### How To Run Project
